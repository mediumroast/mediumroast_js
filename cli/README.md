# Mediumroast for GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface)
The CLI is divided into two sets one for administrative interactions with the system and another for interacting with **Mediumroast for GitHub** objects like Companies and Interactions.  This document covers both the administrative CLI and makes reference to the CLI set for **Mediumroast for GitHub** objects.

# Authentication
**Mediumroast for GitHub** uses either Device Flow or a Personal Access Token for authentication.  The setup CLI will prompt you to choose the type of authentication and then store the necessary information in the `${HOME}/.mediumroast/config.ini` file.  If you need to change the authentication configuration you can run `mrcli setup` to reset the configuration file.

## Required permissions for the Personal Access Token (PAT)
If you create a PAT before the **Mediumroast for GitHub** repository exists the required scope is for **all repositories** in your organization. At PAT renewal or if you want to reduce the scope to only the **Mediumroast for GitHub** repository this can be done later. The Personal Access Token must have the following permissions on all repositories to perform the necessary actions including setup.

- `Actions`: read/write
- `Administration`: read/write
- `Contents`: read/write
- `Metadata`: read
- `Pull requests`: read/write
- `Workflows`: read/write

For background and directions on creating a PAT see the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).
