## Companies
Company objects are central to Mediumroast for GitHub. Interaction sand in the future Studies rely on Companies to function. After setup is run, via `mrcli setup`, two companies are present to work with.  Additional Companies can be added, updated, or removed; essentially, `company` is an `mrcli` sub-command that affords users Create, Read, Update and Delete capabilities.  Each of the major functions for `mrcli company` are described in this document.

### Filter company outputs
The CLI offers the ability to filter outputs by almost any company attribute.  This is manifest by two switches on the company sub-command one specific to finding companies by name, `--find_by_name` and the other by an arbitrary attribute, `--find_by_x`. Note all output format options, like JSON, CSV, etc., are available when the outputs are filtered. Finally, only exact matches are supported, meaning if you want to search for a company using any attribute you have to fully provide the attribute's value (i.e., "Med" would not match Mediumroast, Inc., but "Mediumroast, Inc. would).

#### Filter in a company by name

#### Command(s) run
- `mrcli c --find_by_name="Mediumroast, Inc."`

## Add a company
A command line prompt based wizard steps the user through either a semi-automated process or a fully-automated process to define a company.

In either case the user is asked to verify the steps taken before the company is committed to the repository.
