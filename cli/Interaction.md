## Interactions
After running `mrcli setup` you can start adding Interactions. An Interaction can be as simple as an email thread between an account team and a customer, a detailed customer interview or even documentation about a competitor. Additional Interactions can be added, updated, or removed; essentially, `interaction` is an `mrcli` sub-command that affords users Create, Read, Update and Delete capabilities. Each of the major functions for `mrcli interaction` are described in this document.

### Notice
Some of the command line options and switches may not yet be implemented; therefore, if a switch or option is not yet implemented the CLI will inform the user and then exit.

## Help
Prints the usage for the `interaction` sub-command and exits.

### Command(s) run

### Filter interaction outputs
The CLI offers the ability to filter outputs by almost any interaction attribute.  This is manifest by two switches on the interaction sub-command one specific to finding Interactions by name, `--find_by_name` and the other by an arbitrary attribute, `--find_by_x`. Note all output format options, like JSON, CSV, etc., are available when the outputs are filtered. Finally, only exact matches are supported, meaning if you want to search for a interaction using any attribute you have to fully provide the attribute's value (i.e., "The" would not match "The 7 Strategic Phases of the Product Planning Process" , but "The 7 Strategic Phases of the Product Planning Process" would).

#### Filter in a interaction by name
To zero in on a specific interaction using the find by name switch is provided.

#### Command(s) run
- `mrcli i --find_by_name="The 7 Strategic Phases of the Product Planning Process"`

#### Filter an interaction by attribute
Find a specific interaction by a particular attribute in the example below the switch filters on the attribute `city`.

#### Command(s) run
