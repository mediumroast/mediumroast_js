# Welcome to Open Source Mediumroast for GitHub.
Products organizations (meaning those that combine Product Management and Engineering) must build robust product plans from competitive and customer interactions, derived from product discovery actions, everyone can see, use, and reference. Therefore, Mediumroast for GitHub intends to help Products oranizations construct an active interactions repository close to the action of development and issue management in GitHub.    


# Motivation
Mediumroast, Inc. sees many insights can be drawn from press releases, customer interviews, meeting notes, announcements, document manuals, and more. However, there are key problems we've uncovered as we've interviewed and observed Products Leaders, Product Managers, Engineers, Sellers, Sales Engineers, and Customer Success teams.  These problems are best described through several quotes.

1. "I was just hired as a product manager into a team that is new to me, and was given a folder of documents that somehow relate to my product, but I don't know what these documents tell me." (New Product Manager)
2. "As a Product Manager leader I almost fired one of my PMs because I think they were making things up." (Product Manager Director)
3. "Did a customer really ask for that?" (Engineering Manager)
4. "Are we building this for one customer or all of our customers?" (Chief Product Officer)
5. "Did we interview customers from enough countries or are we only buliding for the US?" (Asia Pacific Pre-Sales Leader)
6. "Who are your competitors?" (Venture Capital Technical Advisor)
7. "Every team keeps their product planning resources and interactions to themselves. We don't share so we don't know who has actually touched the customer." (Product Manager at one of the FAANG companies)
8. "Can you show me what happened to the requirements my customer provided?" (Pre-Sales Personnel)

Certainly, these quotes point to challenging problems covering themes like traceability, transparency, coverage, bias, and many more.  As we thought about what we could do we recognized that any journey to build a robust product plan starts with collecting the right set of interactions in a space that all constituents in the process can see and in the middle of the action.  Where in this case the action is active engineering.  Without a doubt there are tools that assert they are the "single source of truth" for a product's roadmap, and these commercial products more ofthen than not fail to help.  What they fail to do is help you arrive at the truth at the center of your product plan, and our intention, with this project, is to begin Products teams along a journey that let's them get to their best plan.

# Why GitHub?
This way plans aren't static

# Command Line Interface (CLI) for the mediumroast.io
Inclued within this SDK is a CLI for users who are more inclined to use that tool for interacting with the system.  These tools will be added and updated to over time as the system evolves. More information on the CLI is available in the [CLI README](./cli/README.md).
